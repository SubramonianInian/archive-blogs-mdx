#### 1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications.

#### 2. What are the key features of React?

Some key features of React include:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are composed of reusable UI components.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without re-rendering the entire page.
- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows from parent components to child components.
- **Hook**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components.

#### 3. How do you define a React component?

In React, components can be defined as classes or functions. Here's an example of a functional component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
#### 4. What are props in React?

In React, **"props"** (short for properties) are a fundamental concept used for passing data from one component to another. Props are a way of making components dynamic and reusable. They are similar to function arguments in JavaScript.

Here's how props work in React:

1. **Passing Props**: You can pass props from a parent component to a child component by including attributes in the child component's JSX tag. These attributes then become properties of the `props` object in the child component.

    ```jsx
    // ParentComponent.js
    import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

    function ParentComponent() {
        return <ChildComponent name="John" />;
    }
    ```

    ```jsx
    // ChildComponent.js
    function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
    }
    ```

2. **Accessing Props**: In the child component, you can access the passed props through the `props` object.

3. **Immutable Data**: Props are immutable, meaning that child components cannot modify the props passed to them from their parent. Props are read-only.

4. **Default Props**: You can also specify default values for props using the `defaultProps` property.

    ```jsx
    function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
    }

    ChildComponent.defaultProps = {
        name: 'Guest'
    };
    ```

5. **Using Props for Dynamic Rendering**: Props can be used to render components dynamically based on different data passed from the parent component.

    ```jsx
    function UserGreeting(props) {
        return <h1>Welcome back, {props.username}!</h1>;
    }

    function GuestGreeting(props) {
        return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
    }

    function Greeting(props) {
        const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
        if (isLoggedIn) {
            return <UserGreeting username={props.username} />;
        }
        return <GuestGreeting />;
    }
    ```

Overall, props provide a way to pass data between React components, enabling a flexible and reusable component architecture.

#### 5. What is State in React?

In React, **"state"** is a built-in object used for storing component-specific data that may change over time. Unlike props, which are passed from parent to child and remain immutable within the child component, state is managed internally within a component and can be updated using the `setState()` method. State allows components to manage and track their own data, making them dynamic and interactive.

Here are the key points about state in React:

1. **Declaring State**: You can declare state in a React component by initializing the `state` property within the component's constructor.

    ```jsx
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    class MyComponent extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                count: 0,
                message: 'Hello, World!'
            };
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Accessing State**: You can access state data using `this.state` within the component's methods.

    ```jsx
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
                <p>Message: {this.state.message}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

3. **Updating State**: State should be updated using the `setState()` method provided by React. Directly modifying `this.state` will not trigger re-rendering.

    ```jsx
    handleClick = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    }
    ```

4. **Async State Updates**: `setState()` can accept a function as an argument to handle asynchronous updates correctly.

    ```jsx
    handleClick = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => {
            return { count: prevState.count + 1 };
        });
    }
    ```

5. **Immutable State**: Similar to props, state in React components is immutable. You should never modify state directly; always use `setState()` to update it.

6. **Local to Component**: State is local to the component in which it is declared. It cannot be accessed or modified by other components.

Overall, state in React provides a way for components to manage and update their own data, making them dynamic and responsive to user interactions. It's a key concept in building interactive user interfaces with React.
