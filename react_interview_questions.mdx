# Basic React Interview Questions

## 1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications.

## 2. What are the key features of React?

Some key features of React include:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are composed of reusable UI components.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without re-rendering the entire page.
- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows from parent components to child components.
- **Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components.

## 3. How do you define a React component?

In React, components can be defined as classes or functions. Here's an example of a functional component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
