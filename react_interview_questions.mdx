#### 1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications.

#### 2. What are the key features of React?

Some key features of React include:
- Component-Based Architecture: React applications are composed of reusable UI components.
- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without re-rendering the entire page.
- JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files.
- One-Way Data Binding: React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows from parent components to child components.
- Hook: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components.

#### 3. How do you define a React component?

In React, components can be defined as classes or functions. Here's an example of a functional component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
#### 4. What are props in React?

In React, **"props"** (short for properties) are a fundamental concept used for passing data from one component to another. Props are a way of making components dynamic and reusable. They are similar to function arguments in JavaScript.

Here's how props work in React:

1. **Passing Props**: You can pass props from a parent component to a child component by including attributes in the child component's JSX tag. These attributes then become properties of the `props` object in the child component.

    ```jsx
    // ParentComponent.js
    import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

    function ParentComponent() {
        return <ChildComponent name="John" />;
    }
    ```

    ```jsx
    // ChildComponent.js
    function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
    }
    ```

2. **Accessing Props**: In the child component, you can access the passed props through the `props` object.

3. **Immutable Data**: Props are immutable, meaning that child components cannot modify the props passed to them from their parent. Props are read-only.

4. **Default Props**: You can also specify default values for props using the `defaultProps` property.

    ```jsx
    function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
    }

    ChildComponent.defaultProps = {
        name: 'Guest'
    };
    ```

5. **Using Props for Dynamic Rendering**: Props can be used to render components dynamically based on different data passed from the parent component.

    ```jsx
    function UserGreeting(props) {
        return <h1>Welcome back, {props.username}!</h1>;
    }

    function GuestGreeting(props) {
        return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
    }

    function Greeting(props) {
        const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
        if (isLoggedIn) {
            return <UserGreeting username={props.username} />;
        }
        return <GuestGreeting />;
    }
    ```

Overall, props provide a way to pass data between React components, enabling a flexible and reusable component architecture.
